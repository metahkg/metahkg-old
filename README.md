# About
This open-source project was created primarily because of me being unable to register a lihkg account as a high school student.

Currently, it aims to simulate the lihkg experience by having all of its features with the help of material-ui and mongodb. However, I might also add other useful features.

As contrasted with lihkg, metahkg is open to everyone and anyone can create an account with a email address, no matter issued by a university or not.
